each analysis, and the posterior mean and variance for omega.
If \code{plots_out} is turned on, then the MCMC chains mixing and
autocorrelation plots are provided as well.
}
\description{
Computes the predicted probability of success (PoS) for a phase III clinical
trial by integrating early-phase efficacy data—objective response rate (ORR)
and/or progression-free survival (PFS)—with prior beliefs about study
success. The prior distribution for the benchmark PoS is specified as a Beta
distribution, parameterized by its mean and variance. Treatment effect
estimation for ORR supports both two-arm and single-arm designs, with the
latter incorporating historical control information.

  \itemize{
  \item Obtain the prediction of PoS using `run_stan()`
  \item Create an object `fit_stan` to save the model result
  \item Transfer the hazard ratio bound to log-scale
  \item Extract simulated phase 3 trials treatment effects estimates and
  derive their standard errors
  \item Calculates posterior mean and variance of \code{omega}.
  \item If `plots_out` is TRUE, generate plots for MCMC chains and 
  autocorrelation
