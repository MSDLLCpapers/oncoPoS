\item{ci_rr}{confidence level (e.g., 0.80) for the control arm response rate
interval.}

\item{niter}{number of iterations to be used in stan run, Default: 1000}

\item{nchains}{number of chains to be used in stan run, Default: 4}

\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{est}}{Posterior mean of the log odds ratio.}
\item{\code{se}}{Posterior standard deviation (i.e., standard error) of the
log odds ratio.}
}
}
\description{
Estimates the log odds ratio (log OR) between treatment and control arms
in a single-arm trial by combining observed responses in treatment arm with
prior knowledge of the control response rate. The prior distribution on the
control arm's response rate is specified through a credible interval.
}
\details{
This function is useful in single-arm trials where the control arm is not
directly observed. A prior on the control arm's response rate provided as a
credible interval, is transformed into a normal prior on the logit scale.
The posterior distribution of the log odds ratio is then estimated using
Bayesian inference via Stan.

The Stan model (\code{estimate_ctrl.stan}) must be available in the working directory.

  \itemize{
    \item Compute the observed response rate in the treatment arm.
    \item Translate the control response rate bounds into a normal prior on 
    the logit scale.
    \item Fit a Bayesian model to estimate the posterior distribution of the 
    log OR.
    \item Return the posterior mean and standard deviation of the log OR.
